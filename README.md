### Password encrypter + manager
**Stop** using plain text passwords for your online accounts you are making your accounts more prone to a hack.</br>
LoginPod is a password encrypter and password manager written in bash with python3 as supportive backend for encrypting passwords and account password management. Like other encryption algorithm's LoginPod has it's own encryption algorithm which works based on a 5 digit encryption key which is a input from user. Using LoginPod you can encrypt your password's, to make it more strong and store it in password vault.


## Why to use darkboss1 loginsecurity Ak47 and not other password managers ?
+ You don't get flexibility while using other encryption algorithms, but here based on 5 digit encryption key from 00000 to 99999 you get 100000 different encrypted output based on key you entered. 

+ It stores your passwords on your system disk instead of any server keeping you safe in case of any data breach attack.

+ All your password are stored in plain text, passwords are encrypted only at runtime and to get correct password correct 5 digit encryption key must be entered.

+ Stop using online password encrypters as you are giving your passwords to them and they might track you.

+ Really, is there any gurantee that password manager softwares will store your password at their server and never going to peek on them. Better you store them on your system disk.


## Usage
**1.** When you run the script, you are welcomed with this screen where you have to enter 5 digit encryption key on which the encryption algorithm works ranging from 00000 to 88888. For each encryption key entered the algorithm gives different output, so you have to decide a 5 digit encryption key and always use that same encryption key.
